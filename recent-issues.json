https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/, TOML is\n\nHuman-usable (unlike JSON ),\nFlexible (unlike configparser),\nStems from a standard (unlike configparser)\nNot overly complex (unlike YAML).\n\nAlso TOML has been recommended as the configuration file for software packages to specify their build dependencies.\n pyproject.toml is being used for this purpose. https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/pyproject.toml\ncoala could provide TOML as a additional setting format.\n\nBy following a well known standard like TOML, we would reduce the learning curve involved.\nWhen the current system gets complex, TOML will be a better choice than a custom INI.\nIt provides flexibility, consistency, backwards compatibility and stems from a standard all of which are drawbacks of configparser.\n\nThis proposal issue is about supporting a new config file like coafile.toml along with .coafile.\ncoala/coala#4609","comments":6,"createdAt":"2019-02-03T07:37:14Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-25T14:12:24Z","closedAt":"2019-08-25T14:12:24Z","state":"closed","user":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"owner":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"assignee":{"login":"PrajwalM2212","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30733262?v=4"},"labels":[{"name":"Project

However, on cppcheck version 1.76.1 it doesn't give any error.\nIt seems that coala tests are using the previous version of cppcheck, and that's the reason the tests are failing.\nWhat should be done here?","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"gutsytechster","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31796326?v=4","name":"Prashant Sharma"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-12T15:59:46Z","lastEditedAt":"2018-11-12T16:05:44Z","updatedAt":"2018-11-12T16:05:44Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODA4MDk2Ng==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-438080966","bodyText":"@gutsytechster , you need to build a test case which works with the version of cppclean that coala uses.\nSee the file bear-requirements.txt to see which version that is.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-13T00:22:54Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-13T00:22:54Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODE2MzU5NQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-438163595","bodyText":"Isn't cppcheck and cppclean different?\nAnd doesn't CPPCheckBear uses cppcheck?","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"gutsytechster","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31796326?v=4","name":"Prashant Sharma"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-13T07:25:25Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-13T07:25:25Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzODE3NDk3Nw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-438174977","bodyText":"Yes, my apology, I should have said cppcheck","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2018-11-13T08:14:01Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2018-11-13T08:14:01Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDA4NzE4Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-454087182","bodyText":"@jayvdb can you review it?\nI just need to know if I am taking the correct approach for using the Language class defined.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"gutsytechster","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31796326?v=4","name":"Prashant Sharma"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-01-14T17:20:57Z","lastEditedAt":"2019-01-14T17:22:12Z","updatedAt":"2019-01-14T17:22:12Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzc0Njg2MA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-523746860","bodyText":"Tests are still missing 100% coverage","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"jayvdb","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/15092?v=4","name":"John Vandenberg"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-08-22T04:51:49Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-08-22T04:51:49Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzc4MjQ3Mg==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-523782472","bodyText":"Hey @jayvdb can you help to find why appveyor and travis are giving different assertion errors and even though they are passing on local?","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"gutsytechster","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31796326?v=4","name":"Prashant Sharma"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-08-22T07:20:10Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-08-22T07:20:10Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzgwODU4OQ==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-523808589","bodyText":"On researching, I found that the Travis is failing because it is using cppcheck 1.52(https://travis-ci.org/coala/coala-bears/jobs/575212105#L295) which doesn't support the language parameter and hence generating error resulting in return a None object instead of a list type object.","diffHunk":null,"author":{"login":"gutsytechster","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31796326?v=4","name":"Prashant Sharma"},"reactions":[],"createdAt":"2019-08-22T08:37:53Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-08-22T08:37:53Z"},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzgxMjM4Mw==","url":"https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2710#issuecomment-523812383","bodyText":"Appveyor is failing because it is using cppcheck 1.88(https://ci.appveyor.com/project/coala/coala-bears/builds/26877468/job/i2incdndjdui7jvf#L246) which generates different output when using the language parameter.

It allows coala\n+to lint through the files that have a combination of nested languages and provided\n+patches to the user, just like how it's done in the normal mode.\n+\n+* The vast majority of my project was based on laying down the architecuture to make this\n+project possible. And hence, I only implemented the support for the files that have\n+`Python` and `Jinja2` as the combination. That being said, extending the support for\n+other languages is really easy.\n+\n+* The user can switch on nested language mode using:\n+```\n+coala --handle-nested --languages=python,jinja2 --files=test.py.jj2\n+--bears=PEP8Bear,Jinja2Bear,SpaceConsistencyBear\n+```\n+\n+* The argument `--handle-nested` is used to specify that the files has a combination of\n+nested languages. The argument `--languages` is to mention the languages that exists in\n+the files. Note that, it is important to mention the `--languages` argument since coala\n+cannot auto detect the languages present in the nested language file.\n+\n+* Also special care has been taken to keep the signicficant part of the core coala untounched\n+by my implementation. No major changes have been done to the way coala works. This would\n+help as this is still an experimental features and many changes are yet to come.\n+\n+* An asciinema of the working is [here](https://asciinema.org/a/263844)\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+* The most challenging part of the project was to come up with a proper architecuture that\n+would work. I must confess that I put in more than 2 month of time before GSoC to try\n+out various possibilites that might make this project a reality. I am grateful to all\n+the mentors of coala who kept reviewing my various approaches even with their busy\n+schedule, without their insights I would never have been able to finalise on my proposal.\n+\n+* Since this project deals with the core of the coala, I was pretty scared to get into the\n+waters of the huge codebase. But with the constant support of mentors and as the time\n+went on, I was about to understand how the different components of coala actually\n+pieced together.\n+\n+* Another difficult situation that I faced was during my Third Phase of GSoC. The approach\n+I planned out for the assembling of the files did not seem to work. So I was supposed\n+to come with a new approach in a span of 11 days. I was pretty pissed and scared ,but\n+apparently it took lesser time than i expected, this taught me not overestimate the\n+time and take things one at a time.\n+\n+* And last not the least was about maintaining the coverage while implementing the details.\n+It took me time to soak in all the coverage, but it all turned out to be good.\n+\n+* The entire experience was really fun, though at times there were few hair plucking moment\n+but this taught me a lot about how the architectures need to be made and how different\n+components needs to be designed to keep track of scalability.\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+* I've complete almost all of the goals that I had planned out for this GSoC. But there\n+are a lot's of enhancements that can be done to the way of how Nested Language mode\n+can work.\n+\n+The work to be done is:\n+\n+1. Enhance the way how parsing is done. For now it supports most of the cases, but there\n+are few edge cases that I might have missed.\n+2.

It allows coala\n+to lint through the files that have a combination of nested languages and provided\n+patches to the user, just like how it's done in the normal mode.\n+\n+* The vast majority of my project was based on laying down the architecuture to make this\n+project possible. And hence, I only implemented the support for the files that have\n+`Python` and `Jinja2` as the combination. That being said, extending the support for\n+other languages is really easy.\n+\n+* The user can switch on nested language mode using:\n+```\n+coala --handle-nested --languages=python,jinja2 --files=test.py.jj2\n+--bears=PEP8Bear,Jinja2Bear,SpaceConsistencyBear\n+```\n+\n+* The argument `--handle-nested` is used to specify that the files has a combination of\n+nested languages. The argument `--languages` is to mention the languages that exists in\n+the files. Note that, it is important to mention the `--languages` argument since coala\n+cannot auto detect the languages present in the nested language file.\n+\n+* Also special care has been taken to keep the signicficant part of the core coala untounched","author":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4","name":"Viresh Gupta"},"createdAt":"2019-08-25T07:10:49Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-08-25T07:10:49Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDMxNzQwMzQzOA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/744#discussion_r317403438","bodyText":"Closed.

Writing tests for some of the actions implemented\n+which involved deleting a file or amending commit messages was tricky.\n+\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+Main advantage after this project is that now many useful custom actions can\n+be implemented for bears. Identifying where custom actions can be useful\n+and implementing them will be a community driven process.\n+Another thing which can be done is extending some of the existing bears to\n+provide multiple patches.\n+Also allowing actions to be initialized with a custom description would be\n+really helpful.

It can be done using ng but won't it be good if we common usable varibales in one file, instead of splitting them and mentioning it another file? _config.yml is OK to have all CONSTANT variable at one place.

I don't know why people built a custom parser and configuration format instead of using a standard one, but maybe there is some reason.\nWhen coala started out, the syntax did not require custom sub level parsing, so INI style config was good and sufficient.\nBut when we started to implement aspects we had to face with tough task of custom sub level parsing. This makes LineParser and ConfParser more complex and error prone.  coala/coala#4511.  Now it would be nice to have a config system where we would not be limited by its complexity.  It would be much more comfortable if we can focus on implementation of a feature and worry less about how to make the parser accommodate the feature.\nThere will be many edge cases in integrating the TOML format .\nThe only challenge is to define the mapping between current coafile syntax and TOML syntax.\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, LineLengthBear can be easily mapped to bears = [ \"SpaceConsistencyBear\", \"LineLengthBear\" ].\nBut what does files += app.py  map into in TOML ? This has to be decided by the community. What syntax would they like ? No matter what syntax they may like, it can be easily implemented in TOML.\nOther challenge is that TOML parser does not load comments. There is an existing issue to solve this.\nwrite down what will break\nAccording to my current plan, absolutely nothing shall break down. I shall not be altering/interfering any existing functionality.  I will add classes like TomlConfWriter , TomlConfParser  etc, but not break/alter anything.\nThe project flows from configuration to processing to actions. I shall not have to worry about anything that comes after configuration like processing and actions. This is due to the fact that after configuration gathering code provides sections to processing, it goes out of focus. Now I shall create a system that will convert TOML file into sections. So I will not be interfering with the existing parsers and writers of coafile as well . This way I shall not touch the exiting configuration system as well. Essentially no existing parts are modified. The existing Section and Settings class will be used as they are without changing them.\n\nI have written a very detailed plan in https://github.com/PrajwalM2212/Coala-GSoC-Plan.\nI have read the codebase and made a implementation guide.
