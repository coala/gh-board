From npm help package-lock.json:\n\npackage-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.\nThis file is intended to be committed into source repositories, and serves various purposes:\n\nDescribe a single representation of a dependency tree such that teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies.\nProvide a facility for users to \"time-travel\" to previous states of node_modules without having to commit the directory itself.\nTo facilitate greater visibility of tree changes through readable source control diffs.\nAnd optimize the installation process by allowing npm to skip repeated metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages.\n\nOne key detail about package-lock.json is that it cannot be published, and it will be ignored if found in any place other than the toplevel package. It shares a format with npm-shrinkwrap.json(5), which is essentially the same file, but allows publication. This is not recommended unless deploying a CLI tool or otherwise using the publication process for producing production packages.\nIf both package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json are present in the root of a package, package-lock.json will be completely ignored.\n\nThis issue is about reverting the change in #2494

A system-wide configuration file.\n+\n+Project-Wide configuration file\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+It is a convention that the project-wide configuration file is named\n+``.coafile.toml`` and lies in the project root directory.\n+If you follow this convention, simply executing ``coala -T`` from the\n+project root will execute the configuration specified in that file.\n+\n+Settings given in the project-wide configuration file override all settings\n+given by other files and can only be overridden by settings given via the\n+command line interface.\n+\n+User-Wide and System-Wide configuration file\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+You can place a ``.coarc.toml`` file in your home directory to set certain\n+user wide settings. Those settings will automatically be taken for all\n+projects executed with that user.\n+\n+All settings specified here override only settings given by the system\n+wide configuration file which has the lowest priority. The\n+``system_coafile.toml`` must lie in the coala installation directory\n+and is valid for everyone using this coala installation.\n+\n+It can be used to define the type of files you usually don't want to lint,\n+like minified files (e.g. ``*.min.js``) and backup files (e.g. ``*.orig``)::\n+\n+    ignore = [ '**.min.js', '**.orig' ]\n+\n+Basic TOML concepts\n+---------------------\n+This part describes the basic TOML concepts required to write coala\n+configuration files in TOML\n+\n+- TOML is case sensitive. So remember to not have duplicate sections/tables\n+  or duplicate keys in same section.\n+- key-value pairs are building blocks of a TOML document. Use key-value\n+  pairs to specify rules for coala bears.\n+- A table is a collection of key-value pairs. Use a table for specifying\n+  a coala section.\n+\n+This is an example of a coala configuration file written in TOML\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+    [cli]\n+    bears = 'SpaceConsistencyBear'\n+    files = 'src/*.c'\n+    use_spaces = true\n+\n+    [invalidlinks]\n+    enabled = false\n+    files = [ '**/*.rst', 'README.rst']\n+    ignore = 'venv/**'\n+    bears = 'InvalidLinkBear'\n+\n+\n+Here tables ``cli`` and ``invalidlinks`` are coala sections.\n+The contents of the tables like ``bears``, ``files`` are rules\n+that govern a section. To write coala configuration file you will\n+be using TOML strings, booleans, integers and arrays as values.\n+\n+Section Inheritance\n+---------------------\n+coala supports section inheritance. You can define section inheritance\n+by using the key ``inherits``.\n+Extra values can be appended to an inherited setting using the ``appends`` key.\n+\n+Consider the following configuration file in TOML\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 2\n+  ignore = 'vendor1/'\n+\n+  [section1]\n+  overridable = 3\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  appends = 'ignore'\n+  ignore = 'vendor2/'\n+  other = 'some_value'\n+\n+  [section2]\n+  overridable = 4\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  ignore = 'vendor3/'\n+  appends = 'ignore'\n+  other = 'some_other_value'\n+\n+\n+In the inherited sections above, ``appends`` key specifies that the value of\n+``ignore`` in the derived sections must be appended with the value of\n+``ignore`` key in the base section.\n+\n+This is the same file without section inheritance\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 2\n+  ignore = 'vendor1/'\n+\n+  [section1]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 3\n+  ignore = ['vendor1/', 'vendor2/']\n+  other = 'some_value'\n+\n+  [section2]\n+  enabled = true\n+  overridable = 4\n+  ignore = ['vendor1/', 'vendor3/']\n+  other = 'some_other_value'\n+\n+\n+Consider another example\n+\n+Config file in TOML\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+ [all]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+\n+ [java]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+\n+ [python]\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+ inherits = [ 'all', 'java']\n+\n+You can use this syntax to specify multiple inheritance\n+The same in coafile format appears as\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+ [all]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+\n+ [java]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+\n+ [all.python]\n+ a = 1\n+ b = 2\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+\n+ [java.python]\n+ c = 3\n+ d = 4\n+ p = 5\n+ q = 6\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+   - If you want to append multiple settings then use ``appends`` as a list\n+     ::\n+\n+        appends = [ 'a', 'b']\n+   - If you want to inherit multiple sections use ``inherits`` as a list\n+     ::\n+\n+        inherits = [ 'section1', 'section2']\n+   - You can only inherit sections\n+   - You can only append settings\n+   - If  a setting is redefined in the inherited section then it will\n+     overwritten if appends is not used.\n+\n+Defining Aspects and Tastes\n+----------------------------\n+\n+Aspects is an alternative way to configure coala. In this mode, we don't need\n+to explicitly state list of bears, coala will choose it automatically based on\n+requested aspects in configuration file. To run coala in this mode, we need to\n+define `aspects`, `files`, `languages`, and optionally aspect tastes setting.\n+See the following example\n+\n+.. code::\n+\n+  [all]\n+  files = '**'\n+  aspects = ['aspectname1', 'AspectName2'] # case-insensitive\n+  # defining an aspect's taste\n+  aspectname1.aspect_taste = 80\n+  # we can define subaspect taste through its parent\n+  aspectname1.subaspect_taste = ['word1', 'word2', 'word3']\n+\n+  [python]\n+  files = '**.py'\n+  language = 'Python'\n+  inherits = 'all'\n+  # appending additional aspect\n+  appends = 'all'\n+  aspects = 'aspectname3'\n+  # excluding certain subaspect\n+  excludes = 'AspectName2Subaspect'\n+\n+For caofile users who want to write configuration in

Currently, both of them are having that background colors which are going in match with header, body-background as well as text. Also, the yellow-orange color combination is one of the famous combinations.\n\nI also think that these cards should look similar(in color, etc.)\n\nWe can surely do that! but the only issue is space, we can't separate the current main-content div into two div blocks in which one div block will be used for a single card. Also, if we don't choose to create partitions then the concern is where will it be shown at top or bottom of page. Neither of the positions will have a nice UX experience. Showing at home-page will give user a glance giving a nice UX experience and with giving them an additional information that the website has two types of leaderboards related to contribs.
