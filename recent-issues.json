(Thinking more on it if it can be more enhanced).\nSince coala provides a linter for the code so we can provide information on how a particular completed project will benefit other orgs.

So this function tries to infer the datatype from the string for toml in coafile to toml conversion.\nAre you sure this will return the expected type everytime?\nIt handles strings, booleans and list of strings and integers.\nThese are the settings types I have seen used by coala . If more types are used like floats, then then this function can make a provision for that as well.\nSo I think for now it returns the expected types.\nWhere it fails and why failing does not matter\nIf someone writes a = 20 in coafile and wants to mean 20 as a string and not a integer, then this function will fail as it always assumes 20 to be an integer.\nEven if the function fails, it will not break down the functionality. It may appear as an integer in a toml file, but when coala is run all settings will become one single string.\nSo function can fail only in purpose but not in functionality.\nAlso coafile configuration provides no means to specify the data-type in configuration file. So we can make the approximation that makes the best sense for our use-case as there is no source of truth or loss of functionality.","diffHunk":"@@ -0,0 +1,177 @@\n+import os\n+\n+from

It allows coala\n+to lint through the files that have a combination of nested languages and provided\n+patches to the user, just like how it's done in the normal mode.\n+\n+* The vast majority of my project was based on laying down the architecuture to make this\n+project possible. And hence, I only implemented the support for the files that have\n+`Python` and `Jinja2` as the combination. That being said, extending the support for\n+other languages is really easy.\n+\n+* The user can switch on nested language mode using:\n+```\n+coala --handle-nested --languages=python,jinja2 --files=test.py.jj2\n+--bears=PEP8Bear,Jinja2Bear,SpaceConsistencyBear\n+```\n+\n+* The argument `--handle-nested` is used to specify that the files has a combination of\n+nested languages. The argument `--languages` is to mention the languages that exists in\n+the files. Note that, it is important to mention the `--languages` argument since coala\n+cannot auto detect the languages present in the nested language file.\n+\n+* Also special care has been taken to keep the signicficant part of the core coala untounched\n+by my implementation. No major changes have been done to the way coala works. This would\n+help as this is still an experimental features and many changes are yet to come.\n+\n+* An asciinema of the working is [here](https://asciinema.org/a/263844)\n+\n+#### Challenges\n+\n+* The most challenging part of the project was to come up with a proper architecuture that\n+would work. I must confess that I put in more than 2 month of time before GSoC to try\n+out various possibilites that might make this project a reality. I am grateful to all\n+the mentors of coala who kept reviewing my various approaches even with their busy\n+schedule, without their insights I would never have been able to finalise on my proposal.\n+\n+* Since this project deals with the core of the coala, I was pretty scared to get into the\n+waters of the huge codebase. But with the constant support of mentors and as the time\n+went on, I was about to understand how the different components of coala actually\n+pieced together.\n+\n+* Another difficult situation that I faced was during my Third Phase of GSoC. The approach\n+I planned out for the assembling of the files did not seem to work. So I was supposed\n+to come with a new approach in a span of 11 days. I was pretty pissed and scared ,but\n+apparently it took lesser time than i expected, this taught me not overestimate the\n+time and take things one at a time.\n+\n+* And last not the least was about maintaining the coverage while implementing the details.\n+It took me time to soak in all the coverage, but it all turned out to be good.\n+\n+* The entire experience was really fun, though at times there were few hair plucking moment\n+but this taught me a lot about how the architectures need to be made and how different\n+components needs to be designed to keep track of scalability.\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+* I've complete almost all of the goals that I had planned out for this GSoC. But there\n+are a lot's of enhancements that can be done to the way of how Nested Language mode\n+can work.\n+\n+The work to be done is:\n+\n+1. Enhance the way how parsing is done. For now it supports most of the cases, but there\n+are few edge cases that I might have missed.\n+2.

It allows coala\n+to lint through the files that have a combination of nested languages and provided\n+patches to the user, just like how it's done in the normal mode.\n+\n+* The vast majority of my project was based on laying down the architecuture to make this\n+project possible. And hence, I only implemented the support for the files that have\n+`Python` and `Jinja2` as the combination. That being said, extending the support for\n+other languages is really easy.\n+\n+* The user can switch on nested language mode using:\n+```\n+coala --handle-nested --languages=python,jinja2 --files=test.py.jj2\n+--bears=PEP8Bear,Jinja2Bear,SpaceConsistencyBear\n+```\n+\n+* The argument `--handle-nested` is used to specify that the files has a combination of\n+nested languages. The argument `--languages` is to mention the languages that exists in\n+the files. Note that, it is important to mention the `--languages` argument since coala\n+cannot auto detect the languages present in the nested language file.\n+\n+* Also special care has been taken to keep the signicficant part of the core coala untounched","author":{"login":"virresh","avatarUrl":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10978108?v=4","name":"Viresh Gupta"},"createdAt":"2019-08-25T07:10:49Z","lastEditedAt":null,"updatedAt":"2019-08-25T07:10:49Z"},{"id":"MDI0OlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0UmV2aWV3Q29tbWVudDMxNzQwMzQzOA==","url":"https://github.com/coala/projects/pull/744#discussion_r317403438","bodyText":"Closed.

Writing tests for some of the actions implemented\n+which involved deleting a file or amending commit messages was tricky.\n+\n+\n+#### Work to be done\n+\n+Main advantage after this project is that now many useful custom actions can\n+be implemented for bears. Identifying where custom actions can be useful\n+and implementing them will be a community driven process.\n+Another thing which can be done is extending some of the existing bears to\n+provide multiple patches.\n+Also allowing actions to be initialized with a custom description would be\n+really helpful.

As installing the plugin, will also require the same lines which will added if we don't install it and plugin is useful in that case if we're building a complex web application, but we're not. So, IMO it will good to define the variables w/o installing the plugin.\n\nprefer to render using ng\n\nYeah! It can be done using ng but won't it be good if we common usable varibales in one file, instead of splitting them and mentioning it another file? _config.yml is OK to have all CONSTANT variable at one place.

I don't know why people built a custom parser and configuration format instead of using a standard one, but maybe there is some reason.\nWhen coala started out, the syntax did not require custom sub level parsing, so INI style config was good and sufficient.\nBut when we started to implement aspects we had to face with tough task of custom sub level parsing. This makes LineParser and ConfParser more complex and error prone.  coala/coala#4511.  Now it would be nice to have a config system where we would not be limited by its complexity.  It would be much more comfortable if we can focus on implementation of a feature and worry less about how to make the parser accommodate the feature.\nThere will be many edge cases in integrating the TOML format .\nThe only challenge is to define the mapping between current coafile syntax and TOML syntax.\nbears = SpaceConsistencyBear, LineLengthBear can be easily mapped to bears = [ \"SpaceConsistencyBear\", \"LineLengthBear\" ].\nBut what does files += app.py  map into in TOML ? This has to be decided by the community. What syntax would they like ? No matter what syntax they may like, it can be easily implemented in TOML.\nOther challenge is that TOML parser does not load comments. There is an existing issue to solve this.\nwrite down what will break\nAccording to my current plan, absolutely nothing shall break down. I shall not be altering/interfering any existing functionality.  I will add classes like TomlConfWriter , TomlConfParser  etc, but not break/alter anything.\nThe project flows from configuration to processing to actions. I shall not have to worry about anything that comes after configuration like processing and actions. This is due to the fact that after configuration gathering code provides sections to processing, it goes out of focus. Now I shall create a system that will convert TOML file into sections. So I will not be interfering with the existing parsers and writers of coafile as well . This way I shall not touch the exiting configuration system as well. Essentially no existing parts are modified. The existing Section and Settings class will be used as they are without changing them.\n\nI have written a very detailed plan in https://github.com/PrajwalM2212/Coala-GSoC-Plan.\nI have read the codebase and made a implementation guide.
